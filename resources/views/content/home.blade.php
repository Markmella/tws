            <p class="text-content">
                The following is former Supreme Court justice Antonio Carpio's speech at the conferment of 
                his honorary doctoral degree from the University of the Philippines on December 10, 2020. <br><br>

                One of the greatest challenges facing the country today is how to defend and preserve our sovereign rights in our 
                Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the West Philippine Sea (WPS). What is at stake is a maritime area larger than the 
                total land area of the Philippines, and this huge maritime area is rich in fish, oil, gas, and other natural resources. <br><br>

                I remember in early 1995 when China seized from the Philippines Mischief Reef, a submerged atoll within the EEZ of the 
                Philippines in the WPS. I was then the Chief Presidential Legal Counsel of President Fidel Ramos. The Philippines was 
                totally defenseless. We did not have the military capability to take back Mischief Reef. We could not invoke the PH-US 
                Mutual Defense Treaty because Mischief Reef is outside the territory of the Philippines. We could not go to a tribunal 
                under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea or UNCLOS because China had not yet ratified UNCLOS at that time. 
                This incident left a deep scar in my mind – that a powerful state could just grab what legally belonged to a weaker state, 
                and there was no power on earth that could right such a wrong. <br><br>
                
                China had demonstrated to the world that might makes right. Ominously, China was claiming not only Mischief Reef, 
                but 80% of our EEZ in the WPS.   It was obvious that Mischief Reef was neither the first nor the last geologic 
                feature that China would seize from the Philippines. <br><br>

                On August 16, 2011, I penned the unanimous decision in Magallona v. Executive Secretary, upholding the amendment 
                to our archipelagic baselines to conform to UNCLOS. This case opened my eyes – that we could defend and preserve 
                our sovereign rights in the WPS through the Rule of Law by questioning before an UNCLOS tribunal the validity of 
                China’s historic claim under its nine-dash line. We had, however, to first put our house in order by bringing our 
                archipelagic baselines into conformity with UNCLOS so that we could go to an UNCLOS tribunal with clean hands. <br><br>

                The petitioners in Magallona wanted the Supreme Court to declare the waters enclosed by the Treaty of Paris lines as 
                Philippine territorial sea in violation of UNCLOS. As I stressed in my ponencia in Magallona, the absence of UNCLOS-compliant 
                archipelagic baselines “weakens the country’s case in any international dispute over Philippine maritime space.” 
                True enough, one of the judges in the arbitral tribunal at The Hague asked why the Philippines was questioning China’s 
                historic nine-dash line when the Philippines itself had its own historic Treaty of Paris lines. We submitted to the 
                tribunal the Magallona decision to prove that the Philippines had abandoned the Treaty of Paris lines and were already 
                totally compliant with UNCLOS, showing that we had come to the tribunal with clean hands.  Coming to any court or tribunal 
                with unclean hands means getting your case dismissed outright. <br><br>

                On October 29, 2011, barely two months after the Magallona decision, I launched my advocacy to bring China’s 
                nine-dash line before an UNCLOS tribunal. In my address at the 50th Anniversary of the College of Law at the Ateneo 
                de Davao University, I stated: <br><br>

                “If China’s 9-dash line is questioned before an UNCLOS tribunal, there is no doubt that it would be declared as having no 
                basis in international law. China’s 9-dash line simply cannot co-exist with UNCLOS. Upholding one means killing the other. 
                The challenge then, for the Philippines as well as for other states trampled upon by China’s 9-dash line, is how to bring 
                the validity of China’s 9-dash line to an UNCLOS tribunal, given that China has opted out in 2006 from the compulsory dispute 
                settlement mechanism of UNCLOS.” <br><br>

                Fortunately, our own academics and graduates of the University of the Philippines helped find a way out of this jurisdictional 
                dilemma. I had what I called the UNCLOS group, composed of Dr Jay Batongbacal, Dr Diane Desierto, the late Dr Aileen Baviera, 
                Atty Lani Somera, Atty John Molo, Atty Elma Leogardo, and whenever they happened to be in Manila, Dr Suzette Suarez and 
                Dr Lowell Bautista. We met periodically at a Chinese restaurant to find a way to question China’s nine-dash line before an 
                UNCLOS tribunal despite China’s opting out of compulsory arbitration.  The discussions of this UNCLOS group gave me a very 
                clear idea on the way forward. <br><br>

                I submitted to then Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario a Memorandum outlining how the Philippines could initiate 
                an arbitration to question China’s nine-dash line before an UNCLOS tribunal. Secretary del Rosario was very receptive, and 
                he followed my advice to secure the opinion of known international legal experts in the US and Europe on the Law of the Sea 
                to determine the feasibility of questioning China’s nine-dash line before an UNCLOS tribunal. The response from the international 
                legal experts was positive. <br><br>

                Very soon thereafter, China seized Scarborough Shoal from the Philippines following the April-June 2012 standoff between Philippine 
                and Chinese vessels. In December 2012, when President Benigno Aquino III realized that China would remain permanently in 
                Scarborough Shoal, he instructed Secretary del Rosario to file the arbitration case against China. With the preliminary work 
                already mostly done earlier, the Philippines filed the following month, on January 22, 2013, its Statement of Claim against China 
                pursuant to UNCLOS. <br><br>

                The Philippines did not have the military capability to take back Scarborough Shoal in any kind of armed conflict with China. 
                So the Philippines brought China to a forum where there was a level playing field, where the dispute would be resolved based 
                solely on the law and the facts, regardless of how many warships, warplanes, missiles, or nuclear bombs  China possessed. 
                We neutralized China’s military might when we brought the dispute before an UNCLOS tribunal. Might was no longer right. <br><br>

                Secretary Albert del Rosario requested me to explain to foreign policy makers, university academics, and think tanks in Europe, 
                North America, and Asia why the Philippines filed the arbitration case against China and why the Philippines was on the right side 
                of the law, the facts, and history.  And so in 2015 I embarked on a world lecture tour to explain the South China Sea dispute 
                from the Philippine perspective. <br><br>

                To most people, especially those in the West, China’s claim to ownership of the South China Sea since 2,000 years ago seemed 
                plausible because China has an ancient civilization. We had to correct this glaringly erroneous perception. The battle to defend 
                our sovereign rights in the WPS is also a battle for the hearts and minds of the peoples of the world, for in the end we need 
                world opinion on our side to enforce any favorable arbitral ruling against a nuclear-armed China. <br><br>

                The July 12, 2016 Arbitral Award that invalidated China’s nine-dash line has affirmed with finality that the Philippines has 
                a full EEZ in the WPS. And yes, the arbitral tribunal expressly declared that Mischief Reef is part of Philippine EEZ. 
                So if China is still in Mischief Reef, it is there illegally as a squatter. Sea level rise by the end of this century and 
                beyond will submerge all the naturally-formed islands of China in the WPS. Once submerged, they will form part of Philippine 
                EEZ if within 200 nautical miles from our archipelagic baselines. <br><br><br><br>
