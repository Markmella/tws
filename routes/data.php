        "September 11, 2020", 
        "Jim Gomez",

        "MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippine defense chief told his Chinese counterpart on Friday that Manila will adhere “without 
        any possibility of compromise” to a 2016 international arbitration ruling that invalidated most of Beijing’s rival claims in the 
        South China Sea, according to a Philippine statement about the meeting. But the statement was later withdrawn and the contentious 
        comment removed. <br><br>
        
        Chinese Gen. Wei Fenghe is in Manila for talks with Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and President Rodrigo Duterte. His visit 
        follows a series of protests by the Philippines over China’s increasingly aggressive actions in the busy waterway. <br><br>
    
        The territorial disputes between the countries remain unresolved, although their ties have improved greatly under Duterte, who has 
        sought investment, infrastructure funding and military assistance from China. <br><br>
        
        After the defense chiefs met, the Philippine defense department issued an initial statement saying Lorenzana had reaffirmed Philippine 
        adherence “without any possibility of compromise” to the arbitration ruling that invalidated China’s territorial claims in the sea on 
        historical grounds. <br><br>
    
        China refused to participate in the arbitration by a U.N.-backed tribunal, and then dismissed its ruling as a “sham” and 
        continues to defy it. <br><br>
    
        The statement said the Philippine military will continue “to conduct routine, legitimate maritime patrols in the West Philippine Sea and 
        challenge any activities that infringe on Philippine sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction,” using the Philippine name for the 
        portion of the South China Sea closest to it. <br><br>
        
        “While we may not agree on some issues, as good friends and neighbors we remain firm in finding ways to improve our relations,” it quoted 
        Lorenzana as telling Wei. <br><br>
        
        The defense department, however, later recalled the statement without any explanation and replaced it with a version that removed Lorenzana’s 
        assertive remarks. The new statement said the defense chiefs discussed “how to avoid misunderstanding and to resolve differences amicably” in 
        the South China Sea. <br><br>
        
        Wei met later with Duterte, but officials did not immediately release details of their talks. After taking office in 2016, Duterte took steps 
        to improve relations with China that had been severely strained under his predecessor due to the territorial conflicts. <br><br>
    
        Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei also have overlapping claims to the waterway, one of the world’s busiest. Indonesia has also had confrontations 
        with Chinese fishing fleets in coastal waters facing the South China Sea. <br><br>
        
        Although the United States lays no claims to the disputed waters, it has challenged China’s sweeping territorial claims by deploying warships and 
        fighter jets for what it calls freedom of navigation and overflight patrols. <br><br>
        
        In July, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared that Washington regards virtually all of China’s maritime claims in the area outside of its 
        internationally recognized waters to be illegitimate. Although the U.S. officially remains neutral in the disputes, the Trump administration in effect 
        sided with China’s rival claimants. <br><br>
    
        China accused the U.S. of sowing discord in the region, and last month reportedly test-fired two missiles in the South China Sea during 
        live-fire exercises. <br><br><br>",

    array("[OPINION] Law and justice in the West Philippine Sea", 
        "December 12, 2020", 
        "Antonio T. Carpio",

        "The following is former Supreme Court justice Antonio Carpio's speech at the conferment of 
        his honorary doctoral degree from the University of the Philippines on December 10, 2020. <br><br>

        One of the greatest challenges facing the country today is how to defend and preserve our sovereign rights in our 
        Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the West Philippine Sea (WPS). What is at stake is a maritime area larger than the 
        total land area of the Philippines, and this huge maritime area is rich in fish, oil, gas, and other natural resources. <br><br>

        I remember in early 1995 when China seized from the Philippines Mischief Reef, a submerged atoll within the EEZ of the 
        Philippines in the WPS. I was then the Chief Presidential Legal Counsel of President Fidel Ramos. The Philippines was 
        totally defenseless. We did not have the military capability to take back Mischief Reef. We could not invoke the PH-US 
        Mutual Defense Treaty because Mischief Reef is outside the territory of the Philippines. We could not go to a tribunal 
        under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea or UNCLOS because China had not yet ratified UNCLOS at that time. 
        This incident left a deep scar in my mind – that a powerful state could just grab what legally belonged to a weaker state, 
        and there was no power on earth that could right such a wrong. <br><br>
        
        China had demonstrated to the world that might makes right. Ominously, China was claiming not only Mischief Reef, 
        but 80% of our EEZ in the WPS.   It was obvious that Mischief Reef was neither the first nor the last geologic 
        feature that China would seize from the Philippines. <br><br>

        On August 16, 2011, I penned the unanimous decision in Magallona v. Executive Secretary, upholding the amendment 
        to our archipelagic baselines to conform to UNCLOS. This case opened my eyes – that we could defend and preserve 
        our sovereign rights in the WPS through the Rule of Law by questioning before an UNCLOS tribunal the validity of 
        China’s historic claim under its nine-dash line. We had, however, to first put our house in order by bringing our 
        archipelagic baselines into conformity with UNCLOS so that we could go to an UNCLOS tribunal with clean hands. <br><br>

        The petitioners in Magallona wanted the Supreme Court to declare the waters enclosed by the Treaty of Paris lines as 
        Philippine territorial sea in violation of UNCLOS. As I stressed in my ponencia in Magallona, the absence of UNCLOS-compliant 
        archipelagic baselines “weakens the country’s case in any international dispute over Philippine maritime space.” 
        True enough, one of the judges in the arbitral tribunal at The Hague asked why the Philippines was questioning China’s 
        historic nine-dash line when the Philippines itself had its own historic Treaty of Paris lines. We submitted to the 
        tribunal the Magallona decision to prove that the Philippines had abandoned the Treaty of Paris lines and were already 
        totally compliant with UNCLOS, showing that we had come to the tribunal with clean hands.  Coming to any court or tribunal 
        with unclean hands means getting your case dismissed outright. <br><br>

        On October 29, 2011, barely two months after the Magallona decision, I launched my advocacy to bring China’s 
        nine-dash line before an UNCLOS tribunal. In my address at the 50th Anniversary of the College of Law at the Ateneo 
        de Davao University, I stated: <br><br>

        “If China’s 9-dash line is questioned before an UNCLOS tribunal, there is no doubt that it would be declared as having no 
        basis in international law. China’s 9-dash line simply cannot co-exist with UNCLOS. Upholding one means killing the other. 
        The challenge then, for the Philippines as well as for other states trampled upon by China’s 9-dash line, is how to bring 
        the validity of China’s 9-dash line to an UNCLOS tribunal, given that China has opted out in 2006 from the compulsory dispute 
        settlement mechanism of UNCLOS.” <br><br>

        Fortunately, our own academics and graduates of the University of the Philippines helped find a way out of this jurisdictional 
        dilemma. I had what I called the UNCLOS group, composed of Dr Jay Batongbacal, Dr Diane Desierto, the late Dr Aileen Baviera, 
        Atty Lani Somera, Atty John Molo, Atty Elma Leogardo, and whenever they happened to be in Manila, Dr Suzette Suarez and 
        Dr Lowell Bautista. We met periodically at a Chinese restaurant to find a way to question China’s nine-dash line before an 
        UNCLOS tribunal despite China’s opting out of compulsory arbitration.  The discussions of this UNCLOS group gave me a very 
        clear idea on the way forward. <br><br>

        I submitted to then Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario a Memorandum outlining how the Philippines could initiate 
        an arbitration to question China’s nine-dash line before an UNCLOS tribunal. Secretary del Rosario was very receptive, and 
        he followed my advice to secure the opinion of known international legal experts in the US and Europe on the Law of the Sea 
        to determine the feasibility of questioning China’s nine-dash line before an UNCLOS tribunal. The response from the international 
        legal experts was positive. <br><br>

        Very soon thereafter, China seized Scarborough Shoal from the Philippines following the April-June 2012 standoff between Philippine 
        and Chinese vessels. In December 2012, when President Benigno Aquino III realized that China would remain permanently in 
        Scarborough Shoal, he instructed Secretary del Rosario to file the arbitration case against China. With the preliminary work 
        already mostly done earlier, the Philippines filed the following month, on January 22, 2013, its Statement of Claim against China 
        pursuant to UNCLOS. <br><br>

        The Philippines did not have the military capability to take back Scarborough Shoal in any kind of armed conflict with China. 
        So the Philippines brought China to a forum where there was a level playing field, where the dispute would be resolved based 
        solely on the law and the facts, regardless of how many warships, warplanes, missiles, or nuclear bombs  China possessed. 
        We neutralized China’s military might when we brought the dispute before an UNCLOS tribunal. Might was no longer right. <br><br>

        Secretary Albert del Rosario requested me to explain to foreign policy makers, university academics, and think tanks in Europe, 
        North America, and Asia why the Philippines filed the arbitration case against China and why the Philippines was on the right side 
        of the law, the facts, and history.  And so in 2015 I embarked on a world lecture tour to explain the South China Sea dispute 
        from the Philippine perspective. <br><br>

        To most people, especially those in the West, China’s claim to ownership of the South China Sea since 2,000 years ago seemed 
        plausible because China has an ancient civilization. We had to correct this glaringly erroneous perception. The battle to defend 
        our sovereign rights in the WPS is also a battle for the hearts and minds of the peoples of the world, for in the end we need 
        world opinion on our side to enforce any favorable arbitral ruling against a nuclear-armed China. <br><br>

        The July 12, 2016 Arbitral Award that invalidated China’s nine-dash line has affirmed with finality that the Philippines has 
        a full EEZ in the WPS. And yes, the arbitral tribunal expressly declared that Mischief Reef is part of Philippine EEZ. 
        So if China is still in Mischief Reef, it is there illegally as a squatter. Sea level rise by the end of this century and 
        beyond will submerge all the naturally-formed islands of China in the WPS. Once submerged, they will form part of Philippine 
        EEZ if within 200 nautical miles from our archipelagic baselines. <br><br><br>",

        "MANILA - The country's conflict in the West Philippine Sea is with China only and not with other claimants, 
        Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. said Tuesday. <br><br>
        
        Locsin, in a series of tweets, dismissed suggestions that the Philippines is in conflict with other claimants who had 
        taken features before the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS) was adopted. <br><br>

        The top diplomat was agreeing with the position of former Supreme Court justice Antonio Carpio, a long-time advocate of 
        the country's sovereignty in the disputed waters. <br><br>

        “To make it even clearer: when Viet fishermen 'poach' in our EEZ though close to features they claim, we arrest them—and 
        let them go in the spirit of amity because VIETNAM IS NOT TRYING TO TAKE WHAT'S OURS. So Carpio 1000% correct: our only 
        conflict in SCS/WPS is with China,” Locsin

        “SO ANY SUGGESTION THAT WE ARE AS MUCH IN CONFLICT WITH other claimants of features they had taken well before 
        UNCLOS was adopted to confer EEZs IS PURE BULLSHET AND PATHETIC TRYING TO EXCUSE SOFT-PEDALING APPROACH TO 
        YIELDING WHAT'S OURS. NO WAY HOSAY!!” <br><br>

        China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan have competing claims in the South China Sea. <br><br>

        The Philippines calls the part of the South China Sea it claims as the West Philippine Sea. <br><br>

        In 2016, an International arbitration court ruled that China's sweeping claims over almost the entire South 
        China Sea has no legal basis. Beijing is disregarding the landmark decision. <br><br>

        At a House budget hearing on Monday, Locsin said there was no need to file diplomatic protests against other 
        claimants in the South China Sea that have no active conflict with the Philippines. <br><br>

        Manila has filed several diplomatic protests against Beijing this year for declaring portions of Philippine

        South China Sea, though the drills were reduced in scale due to the coronavirus pandemic. <br><br>


        The countries are proceeding with the exercises, which were postponed last year due to the pandemic, after Manila recently 
        accused China of territorial incursions by hundreds of its vessels manned by militias in the South China Sea. <br><br>
        
        Chinese diplomats, however, have said the boats were just sheltering from rough seas and no militia were aboard. <br><br>

        in tabletop and simulation form rather than field training. <br><br>
        
        Social distancing protocols significantly cut the number of troops participating to nearly a thousand from close to 8,000

        All ground exercises were cancelled except for live fire exercises which do not entail face-to-face engagement, 
        Major General Edgard Arevalo, the exercise director, said in a speech. <br><br>
        
        In a speech read by his undersecretary, Philippine Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the joint drills would

    array("Philippines summons Chinese ambassador over reef dispute",
        "April 13, 2021",
        "AP",

        "The Philippine government summoned the Chinese ambassador to press its demand for Chinese vessels to immediately leave a 
        reef claimed by Manila in the South China Sea and said their presence was stoking tensions, officials said Tuesday. <br><br>

        The escalating feud between Manila and Beijing started after more than 200 Chinese vessels suspected by Philippine authorities 
        to be operated by militias were spotted early last month at Whitsun Reef. The Philippine government demanded the vessels 
        leave then deployed coast guard and patrol vessels to the area but China said it owns the reef and the Chinese vessels were 
        sheltering from rough seas. <br><br>
        
        After summoning Ambassador Huang Xilian on Monday, Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Elizabeth Buensuceso expressed to 
        him Manila's “displeasure over the illegal lingering presence of Chinese vessels around Julian Felipe Reef,” the foreign 
        affairs department said in a statement, using the Philippine name for Whitsun Reef in the most hotly disputed Spratlys 
        region of the busy waterway. <br><br>
        
        “The continuing presence of Chinese vessels around the reef is a source of regional tension,” Buensuceso said. <br><br>
        
        She reiterated to Huang that the reef, which lies about 175 nautical miles (324 kilometers) west of the Philippine 
        province of Palawan, is within an internationally recognised offshore zone where Manila has the exclusive right to 
        exploit fisheries, oil, gas and other resources. <br><br>
        
        She also cited a 2016 ruling in an international arbitration case the Philippines brought against China that invalidated 
        Beijing's vast claims on historical grounds to virtually all of the South China Sea under a 1982 U.N. maritime treaty. <br><br>
        
        The Philippine military has said aerial surveillance showed some of the Chinese vessels have left the reef but more 
        than 40 remained moored in the area in late March. It debunked China's claim that the vessels were sheltering from 
        rough seas saying the weather has been fine around the reef. <br><br>
        
        The United States has said it would stand by the Philippines amid the standoff. The Department of National Defense 
        in Manila said last week that the Philippines could seek the help of the U.S., with which it has a mutual defense 
        treaty, to protect its interests in the South China Sea. <br><br>
        
        The Philippines' high-profile protests against China over Whitsun has unfolded amid the cozier relations President 
        Rodrigo Duterte nurtured with China after taking office in mid-2016. Duterte has been repeatedly criticized for not 
        immediately demanding Chinese compliance with the 2016 arbitration ruling and taking a stronger stand against China's 
        actions in the disputed waters. <br><br>
        
        The Spratly chain of islands, islets and atolls are claimed entirely or partly by China, the Philippines, Vietnam, 
        Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei. China has turned seven disputed reefs into missile-protected island bases in recent years, 
        ratcheting up tensions in what has long been feared as a potential flashpoint in Asia. <br><br><br>",

        The following were deployed by the government to boost maritime law enforcement and patrols, according to the task force: 
        
        4 Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) vessels <br>
        
        1 PCG aircraft <br>
        5 Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) vessels <br>
        Philippine National Police - Maritime Group (PNP-MG) high speed tactical watercraft and rubber boats <br>
        
        'The foregoing whole-of-nation approach to protect our national interest in the WPS manifests the firm rejection of the Philippine 
        Government of any attempt to undermine the 2016 Arbitral Award,' the statement read. <br><br>
        
        NTF-WPS also pointed out that they are 'exhausting all means' to protect the country's territory and EEZ. <br><br>
        
        Aside from these, the government is also ramping up development efforts with an P8.8-billion program for the 'environmental 
        protection, security, safety and sustainable development' in Kalayaan. <br><br>
        
        This is in line with the plan of the Palawan Council for Sustainable Development (PCSD), according to NTF-WPS. <br><br>

        Fishery Management Areas have also been established there to conserve and manage fish resources in Philippine waters. <br><br>
        
        This will be coordinated by local government units near the area, BFAR, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, and the 
        Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG). <br><br>
        
        'As mandated, the establishment of Fishery Management Areas, and the DENR has further proposed the declaration of a marine protected 
        landscape and seascape covering the Pag-asa Islands and eastern parts of the Kalayaan Island Group,' the task force explained, 
        referring to the islands within the Philippines' EEZ. <br><br>
        
        The move came after the task force spotted at least 240 Chinese ships located in different parts of the West Philippine Sea last week, 
        denouncing their presence in the country's territory. <br><br>
        
        This prompted Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. to file a fresh diplomatic protest against Beijing. <br><br>
        
        The Department of Foreign Affairs also confirmed it is still filing daily diplomatic protests over China’s continued presence 
        at the Julian Felipe Reef (Whitsun Reef), where at least 9 of their ships remained. <br><br>
        
        Analysts and several countries earlier warned China of its incursions in the West Philippine Sea, as it could threaten 
        regional stability. <br><br>
        
        The United States, Japan, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom have voiced their concerns on the matter. <br><br>
        
        President Rodrigo Duterte has pursued friendlier relations with China upon assuming power in 2016, shelving the maritime 
        disputes in favor of economic aid and investments. <br><br><br>",
